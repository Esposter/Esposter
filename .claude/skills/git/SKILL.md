# Git Conventions

## Commit Message Format

```text
<type>: <description>

<optional body>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`

## Multi-line Commit Messages — Tool-Specific Syntax

The **Bash** tool is POSIX sh, NOT PowerShell. Never use PowerShell here-string syntax (`@'...'@`) in the Bash tool — it is taken literally and leaves stray `@` lines in the commit message. Pick the form matching the tool:

- **Bash tool** → heredoc piped to `-F -`:

  ```bash
  git commit -F - <<'EOF'
  fix: short subject

  Body line.
  EOF
  ```

- **PowerShell tool** → single-quoted here-string with `@'` / `'@` at column 0:

  ```powershell
  git commit -m @'
  fix: short subject

  Body line.
  '@
  ```

After committing, verify with `git log -1 --format='%B'` before pushing.

## Safety Rules

- **Never use `git stash`** — a failed/forgotten pop loses in-progress changes. To inspect prior committed state, use `git show HEAD:path/to/file` or `git diff HEAD`. To set work aside, make a WIP commit.

## Branch Hygiene

- Always create feature branches from `develop`, not `main`
- PRs target `develop`; `develop` merges to `main` for releases
- Delete branches after merging
