# Monorepo Tooling — Architecture

How workspace package scripts, dependency installs, publishing, and CI runners are organized.

---

## Package Management

Esposter uses **pnpm workspaces** as the package manager and workspace script runner. Workspace packages are declared in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and package versions are centralized in the root catalog.

Use the root `package.json` scripts as the canonical entry points for cross-package work. Package-local scripts should stay small and predictable (`build`, `lint`, `lint:fix`, `typecheck`, `test`, `export:gen`) so root recursive commands can compose them. Coverage is not a package-local script — it is owned entirely by the root `vitest` `projects` run.

---

## Recursive Script Orchestration

Use pnpm recursive commands instead of Lerna Lite for running scripts across packages.

Common patterns:

```bash
pnpm -r run build
pnpm -r --parallel --aggregate-output run lint
pnpm -r --parallel --aggregate-output run typecheck
pnpm -r --filter "!@esposter/app" run build
pnpm --filter @esposter/app run build
```

Guidelines:

- Tests are the exception: `test`/`coverage` run through one root `vitest.config.ts` `projects` config (a single `vitest run`), not a recursive fan-out, so the whole suite shares one run, one coverage report, and one `--shard` axis.
- Use `--parallel` for independent checks such as linting and typechecking.
- Use `--aggregate-output` in CI-style commands so package logs remain readable.
- Use filters instead of Lerna scopes/ignores.
- Keep `build:packages` separate from `build:app`; the app can depend on compiled package output.
- Use `--if-present` only for scripts that are optional across packages.
- Pass tool flags with `pnpm exec <binary> <args>` (e.g. `pnpm exec vitest run --shard=1/4`), or as direct args (`pnpm test -u`). Do **not** use the `pnpm <script> -- <args>` separator form — pnpm forwards the literal `--` into the script's arguments, so the underlying tool treats the trailing flags as post-`--` positionals and silently ignores them (this dropped `--shard`/`--reporter` in CI).

---

## Lerna Lite

Lerna Lite is retained for publishing only.

Keep:

```bash
lerna publish --yes
```

Do not use Lerna Lite for recursive script execution or watch orchestration. If a root script is not publishing, prefer pnpm workspace commands.

This means `@lerna-lite/cli` and `@lerna-lite/publish` remain in dev dependencies, while `@lerna-lite/run` and `@lerna-lite/watch` are unnecessary.

---

## Dependency Installs

Use plain `pnpm i` from the repo root when package manifests change.

Do not set `CI=true` locally to bypass pnpm prompts, and do not use `pnpm install --config.confirmModulesPurge=false` or other store override workarounds. Those approaches can create a local `.pnpm-store/` in the repository.

When only dependency versions change, follow the dependency update process and refresh the lockfile with:

```bash
pnpm refresh:lockfile
```

To bump the node version, run `pnpm update:node [version]` — it edits `engines.node` + the `@types/node` catalog, installs/switches via fnm, and removes the old version in one call (then refresh the lockfile). See the `dependency-updates` skill.

---

## CI Job Shape

A single `build-packages` job gates the package-consuming checks, and a `warm-snapshot` job (also `needs: build-packages`) captures virrun's warm dependency snapshot once per run. The virrun verify checks — `format`, `lint`, `typecheck` — `needs: [build-packages, warm-snapshot]` and run `setup-packages` with `install: false`: they fork the warm snapshot for node_modules instead of a host `pnpm i`, downloading only the compiled `package-builds` artifact (the action exposes the `virrun` bin from it). `build documentation`, `coverage`, and `build app` `needs: build-packages` and install normally. → [virrun CI](https://github.com/Esposter/Esposter/blob/main/packages/virrun/readme/ci.md#snapshot-cache)

```text
build-packages ─┬─▶ warm-snapshot ─┬─▶ format
                │                  ├─▶ lint
                │                  └─▶ typecheck
                ├─▶ build documentation
                ├─▶ coverage (×4 shards) ─▶ merge coverage
                └─▶ build app
```

Tests run through a single root `vitest.config.ts` with a `projects: ["packages/*", <scripts>]` config — every package (the app as a Nuxt project via `defineVitestProject`, the rest by their own configs) plus the root `scripts/` suite is one project in one vitest run. So `coverage`/`test` are now `vitest run` at the root, not a `pnpm -r` fan-out. `coverage` runs as a 4-way matrix: `pnpm exec vitest run --coverage --reporter=blob --shard=i/4` splits _all_ test files across runners (each shard runs a distinct quarter and writes the collision-safe `.vitest-reports/blob-i-4.json`, which carries that shard's coverage data). A dependent `merge coverage` job downloads all four blobs and runs `pnpm exec vitest run --merge-reports --coverage` to recombine them into one unified coverage report — this re-emits the report only, it does not re-run tests. CI invokes `vitest` via `pnpm exec` (not `pnpm coverage -- …`) because pnpm does not reliably forward post-`--` args to the script here, which silently dropped `--shard`/`--reporter`. This shortens the coverage work itself but not total CI time, which is gated by `lint`; it is kept for faster test-failure feedback and so every suite (previously `vue-phaserjs` and the `scripts/` tests were skipped by the coverage fan-out) is now covered. There are no coverage thresholds, so a partial per-shard report cannot false-fail. Matrix shards are isolated runners with no shared filesystem, so each repeats checkout + install + `setup-packages`; the package _build_ is not repeated (it is downloaded as an artifact), so the per-shard cost is setup only.

The `build-packages` job builds the packages once and uploads `packages/*/dist` plus the generated `packages/*/src/**/index.ts` barrels as a single `package-builds` artifact (both share the `packages/` common ancestor, so consumers download into `packages`; neither path is a dotfile, so no `include-hidden-files`). The build itself is gated by an `actions/cache`: the key is the git tree hash of every workspace package except the app, plus the lockfile and catalog blobs — a tree hash covers only _tracked_ files, so generated/gitignored output (`dist`, barrels, `*.tsbuildinfo`, `node_modules`) is excluded by construction and there is no glob list to keep in sync; any tracked build-input change rebuilds, while app-only commits (the app is excluded from the key) hit. On a cache hit `pnpm build:packages` is skipped and the restored output is uploaded as-is; on a miss the job builds and seeds the cache. The downstream `setup-packages` composite installs dependencies (or skips that via `install: false` for the snapshot-backed verify jobs) and downloads the artifact — no build, no per-job cache.

The shared gate is preferred over per-job caching because the package _build_ then happens at most once per run (no redundant parallel rebuilds on a package-change commit), and on the common app-only commit (≈68% of commits) the gate's own build is a cache hit, so the gate cost collapses to install + restore + upload. The trade is the serial gate wait before the consuming checks start.

The generated barrels must be cached alongside `dist` because `build:packages` runs `export:gen` and the barrel files are not committed — TypeDoc and the package lint/typecheck steps fail without them even when `dist` is present. Preserve all generated source index files, not just root `src/index.ts`, since some generators create nested barrels.

---

## CI Security

Set `persist-credentials: false` on every `actions/checkout` step.

Declare job permissions explicitly and narrowly:

- Read-only jobs: `contents: read`, add `actions: read` when downloading artifacts.
- OIDC deployment jobs: `id-token: write`, `contents: read`.
- Release jobs: `contents: write`.
- PR-commenting previews: minimum scopes for OIDC, repo reads, and PR comments.

---

## Local Verification

Run local formatting checks from the repo root with:

```bash
pnpm format:check
```

Run local lint fixing from `packages/app` with:

```bash
pnpm lint:fix
```

Do not run Vitest on Windows unless explicitly requested. This repo has known Windows startup failures around Vite/Rolldown config loading and UnoCSS/happy-dom paths. Prefer writing focused tests and leaving execution to CI or a supported environment.

## GitHub Action Versions

Pin actions to full commit SHAs with a trailing version comment:

```yaml
uses: actions/checkout@df4cb1c069e1874edd31b4311f1884172cec0e10 # v6.0.3
```

To resolve the SHA for a pin, look up the latest stable `vX.Y.Z` tag via:

```bash
git ls-remote --tags --sort='v:refname' https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git 'v*'
```

Ignore broad aliases (`v6`) and pre-release tags. For annotated tags `git ls-remote` prints both `refs/tags/<version>` and `refs/tags/<version>^{}`— pin the `^{}` (dereferenced) SHA.

Use normal zipped artifacts unless there is a measured need for direct artifact uploads. If artifact uploads use `archive: false`, use `actions/download-artifact` v8 or newer so direct/non-zipped artifacts are handled correctly.
