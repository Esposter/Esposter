# Parity passes

Each component's last `pnpm -C scripts genshin:parity passes <component>`, which rewrites its own section: every
pass in order up to the first whose gate fails or that has no measure yet, which is the next work. Commit it with
the change that moved it, as a bench's report is committed.
