# Parity scores

Every reference's last `pnpm -C scripts genshin:parity compare`, which rewrites its own row (`--all` rewrites them
all). The mean difference, the tone and FLIP's perceptual error run from 0 (identical) up; the shape is the share of
the reference's edges the shot shares, 1 identical. Commit it with the change that moved it, as a bench's report is
committed.
