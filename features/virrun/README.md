# virrun

An ephemeral, in-memory virtual runner: boot any repo into a RAM-backed filesystem, run its **real toolchain** (pnpm/npm, native addons, scripts) fast and isolated, then **snapshot and fork** the warm state so repeated runs are near-instant.

Standalone OSS project (eventually its own repo / `packages/virrun*`); design docs incubate here. This README is the index.

## What it is — and is not

- **Not a VFS.** The virtual filesystem is a _reused_ layer (`node:vfs` / `@platformatic/vfs`), not the product.
- **It is a runtime.** The product is the layer that **runs real processes** against that FS, isolates them, and snapshots/forks them. node:vfs _stores_ files; this _runs_ the toolchain over them.

## Design goals

The point is **developer experience through speed** — make the everyday toolchain (install, build, test, lint) dramatically faster by removing the two things that make it slow:

- **Network-bound waits** — deps are fetched once into a shared store and reused; a warm snapshot skips install entirely. Re-runs don't re-download.
- **Disk I/O** — files live in a RAM filesystem; `node_modules` and build output never touch real disk.

Plus: **ephemeral** (spin up / throw away, no polluted machine state), **reproducible** (same source + lockfile → same warm snapshot), **isolated** (a run can't corrupt the host), and **drop-in** (existing commands run unchanged — no per-repo rewrite).

**Adoption is a goal, not an afterthought.** A repo moves commands onto the sandbox one at a time, behind a single `virrun -- <cmd>` prefix, with auto-fallback to native — so trying it costs one token and reverting costs one token. See [specs/adoption.md](specs/adoption.md).

## Gates (non-negotiable)

Two pass/fail gates on every backend and speed feature — a violation is not shippable, however clever: **faster than the native baseline**, and **observably correct** (exit code, stdout/stderr, produced files, dependency tree) vs running the command natively. Correctness beats speed; a fast wrong answer is worthless. Detail: [benchmarking](specs/benchmarking.md) · [correctness](specs/correctness.md).

## Now

Phase 1 (the `vfs` backend) is shipped. **Phase 2 — the `os` backend** is underway: **Step A landed** — `BackendType.Os` runs any command inside a `bubblewrap` RAM-overlay (reads fall through to the source, writes stay in an invisible tmpfs upper), breaking the **subprocess wall** the in-process VFS can't see past → [architecture.md](architecture.md). It is opt-in and Linux-only; it is held out of _Shipped_ below until the Linux-gated CI suite is green. Next is **Step B** — the acceptance test (`pnpm install` + a native postinstall running fully in RAM) → [roadmap.md](roadmap.md).

## Shipped

Terse log; the linked spec holds the detail.

- **Phase 0 — foundations**: `virrun` (public, unscoped) — the `ExecBackend` seam, native passthrough backend, async `createVirrun`, `dir`/`files`/`git` source loaders, the `virrun -- <cmd>` CLI, and the `pnpm bench` foundation (colocated per-file `*.bench.{json,md}`). → [orchestrator-api](specs/orchestrator-api.md) · [adoption](specs/adoption.md) · [benchmarking](specs/benchmarking.md)
- **`vfs` Step A — FS layer**: `FsProvider` + `createPlatformaticFsProvider` over `@platformatic/vfs` (the lone import, doubling as the `node:vfs` swap shim); mounting patches `require`/`fs` to serve virtual files; cross-platform. → [virtual-fs](specs/virtual-fs.md)
- **`vfs` Step B — in-process runner** (both gates passed): `BackendType.Vfs` runs `node -e`/`--eval` and `node <file>` in the current process over an overlay-mounted FS, falling back to native for anything it can't run faithfully. Opt-in only — no isolation yet, so `Auto` stays native. → [exec-isolation](specs/exec-isolation.md)

## Decisions

Grep [out-of-scope/](out-of-scope) and [deferred/](deferred) before adding a roadmap item.

- [out-of-scope/pure-js-exec.md](out-of-scope/pure-js-exec.md) — why a pure-JS interpreter (just-bash style) can't be the exec engine.
- [deferred/wasm-runtime.md](deferred/wasm-runtime.md) — WebContainers-style WASM-node backend, parked with a revisit trigger.
- [deferred/citty-cli.md](deferred/citty-cli.md) — delegate the CLI to unjs/citty once it grows real subcommands/flags.
- [deferred/ci-bench-gate.md](deferred/ci-bench-gate.md) — enforce the bench + differential suites as required CI gates once a backend can actually regress.
- [deferred/whole-repo-routing.md](deferred/whole-repo-routing.md) — why "route every command at once" waits for warm-fork; adopt one command at a time instead.
