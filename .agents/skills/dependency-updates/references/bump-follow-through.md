# What a Bump Owes Beyond the Version

Read when any bump lands, before committing it: the `@TODO`s, snapshots and generated fields a version change moves.

Every `@TODO` linking the bumped package is read against the release: a workaround the new version makes redundant goes in the bump's own commit (`todos` skill, "When to revisit").

When `@electric-sql/pglite` changes between minor versions, regenerate the db-mock data directory snapshot from `packages/db-mock/` with `pnpm snapshot:gen`, then verify the db-mock tests. The committed `packages/db-mock/src/snapshot.tar.gz` is tied to PGlite's dump format and may need refreshing even without schema changes.

When `unocss` changes, `apps/web/uno.config.test.ts` is the check: it snapshots resolved config, so a failure is the upstream release moving a derived rule, colour or default, and it is the only place that shows. **Read the diff and account for it in the commit before regenerating** — a reflexive `-u` throws away the one signal the bump produces. The `unocss` skill owns the detail.

`inlinedDependencies` in a package manifest is written by tsdown on every build, so a vendored package's bump lands in a reviewed diff — every package included, `apps/functions` among them: it keeps the `main` the Functions host reads through `exports: { legacy: true }` rather than by switching generation off, and generation is the same write that records the list. Nothing there is hand-maintained, so a recorded version that no longer exists under `node_modules/.pnpm` is a build nobody re-ran rather than an edit nobody made — rebuild and read the diff, which is also the explanation on offer for that package's bundle size moving when nothing in its own manifest did.

Any bump that reaches a `dist/` moves the bundle size snapshots. Refresh them per the `testing` skill's `references/platform-and-bundle-tests.md` — rebuild first, then the narrowed `-u` pair — never by editing a snapshot to the number a failure printed.
